# CodeAlpha_Car_Price_Prediction

## Project Overview
Buying or selling a used car can be challenging because prices vary based on many factors. This project aims to build a model that predicts the selling price of a car based on details like its age, original price, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission, and ownership history.
A good price prediction can help sellers set fair prices and buyers know if they are getting a good deal. This makes the process more transparent and efficient for everyone in the used car market.
